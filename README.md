# Hi, this is Mohamed 
I'm interested in making things better together. The key to progress is communication. 

## What's this? (TLDR;)
I believe by sharing a bit about me and my workstyle we can be more effective.

## About me
I am married and I live in Brooklyn NY. I was born not to far from where I live but I have traveled quit a bit. I've started my career as a web developer while in college. I managed my first team when I was 19. I enjoy making photographs, comedy, and watching football (soccer) with friends and family.

## My goals 
I hope by the end of the year I can say Product Management is better 


## How I work
