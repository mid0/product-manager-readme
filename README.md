# Hi, this is Mohamed 
I'm interested in making things better together. The key to progress is communication. 

## What's this? (TLDR;)
I believe by sharing a bit about me and my work-style we can be more effective.

## About me
I am married and I live in Brooklyn NY. I was born not to far from where I live but I have moved around a bit. I've started my career as a web developer while in college. I managed my first team when I was 19. I enjoy making photographs and watching football (soccer) with friends and family.

## My beliefs
My role is to maximize value given current condition.
People are before process, process before platforms and platforms before products. 
Successfull products are products that have a large intersection between value, viability, usability, and feasibility.

## Myy Work-style (WIP)
* I start my day at First Light
* I prefer in-person or communication over video
* I prefer white-boards over slides (OR Miro/Mural)
* When invited to a meeting where decisions are expected to be made, should include a couple of pages on what you deem as best course of action and why
** Ideally, you should also anticipate what stakeholders will ask and answer them in the same or seperate document 
* Time that is unblocked in my calendar is for you to book
* I check my emails at least once a day. I will answer within 24 hours.
* For Urgent matters you can text me
* Matters require my attention same-day (TBD)
