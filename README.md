# Hi, this is Mohamed 
I'm interested in making things better together. The key to progress is communication. 

## What's this?
I believe by sharing a bit about me and my work-style, we can be more effective.

## A bit about me
I am married, and I live in Brooklyn, NY. I was born not too far from where I live, but I have moved around a bit. I've started my career as a web developer while in college. I managed my first team when I was 19. I enjoy making photographs and watching football (soccer) with friends and family.

## Some of my beliefs
My role is to maximize value given current condition.

People > process, process > platforms and platforms > products.

Successful products are products that have a healthy intersection between value, viability, usability, and feasibility.

## My Work-style (WIP)
* I start my day at First Light
* I prefer in-person or communication over video
* I like white-boards over slides (Live Miro/Murall sessions work too)
* 1:1s are weekly are for feedback and development
* Book time on my calendar directly
* I check my emails a few times a day. I will answer within 24 hours
* For urgent matters, you can text me
* Matters require my attention on the same-day; send me a slack message
