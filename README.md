# Hi, this is Mohamed 
I'm interested in making things better together.

## What's this?
I believe by sharing a bit about me and my work-style, we can be more effective. This page is intended for current & feature colleagues and team members to learn more about me.

## A bit about me
I am married, and I live in Brooklyn, NY. I was born not too far from where I live, but I have moved around a bit. My career has spanned over 20 years, starting as a web developer while in college. I managed my first team when I was 19 and co-founded a startup in the UK 5+ years ago. I enjoy making photographs and watching football (soccer) with friends and family.

## Some of my beliefs
* My role is to maximize value given current condition.
* People > process, process > platforms and platforms > products.
* Successful products are products that have a healthy intersection between value, viability, usability, and feasibility.

## My Work-style
* I start my day at First Light
* I prefer in-person or communication over video
* I like white-boards over slides (Live Miro/Mural sessions work too)
* 1:1s are weekly and for feedback and development
* Book time on my calendar directly
* I check my emails a few times a day. I will answer within 24 hours
* For urgent matters, you can text me
* Matters require my attention on the same-day; send me a slack message
* More on my [work-style](https://app.tealhq.com/work-styles/public/summary/3d1c5a54-41c8-45a6-a751-a4a6bda2fa75)

## Our 1:1s
* Held weekly ranging from 30 mins to an hour
* Its key purpose is maximizing and achieving your potential

## Feedback
* We are as good as our feedback loop
* Frequent, on-time, and in private
